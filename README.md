# thats_so_rayven
A ray tracer written in rust based on this [book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
## Reasoning
Really just a toy project that allowed me to explore the Rust language and even delve into ray tracing! 

## Running it
- If you haven't already, [download rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Run `cargo run --release >> output.ppm` after configuring the variables and scenes

## Current Output
